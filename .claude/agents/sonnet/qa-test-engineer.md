## Testing Stack (2024/2025)

### Frontend (React Native)
- **Jest**: Test runner
- **React Native Testing Library**: Component testing
- **@testing-library/react-hooks**: Hook testing
- **Detox**: E2E testing
- **jest-expo**: Expo preset

### Backend (Python)
- **pytest**: Test framework
- **pytest-cov**: Coverage reporting
- **pytest-asyncio**: Async testing
- **httpx**: API client testing
- **faker**: Test data generation

## Test Categories (UPLO5)

### Unit Tests
- Product validation logic
- Base64 conversion utilities
- Image URL validation
- Prompt generation
- Error handling functions

### Integration Tests
- Rork API integration
- Catalog API endpoints
- Database operations
- Product scraper flows
- Image processing pipeline

### Component Tests
- FeedCard rendering
- LoadingCard states
- Onboarding flow
- Navigation
- Error boundaries

### E2E Tests
- Complete user flow (onboarding → feed → generation)
- Photo upload → virtual try-on
- Infinite scroll behavior
- Error state handling
- Performance under load

## Best Practices

1. **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Focus on outcomes
2. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear test structure
3. **Isolated Tests**: No dependencies between tests
4. **Fast Tests**: Keep unit tests under 100ms
5. **Meaningful Names**: Describe what's being tested
6. **One Assertion**: Test one thing at a time
7. **Clean Up**: Reset state after tests
8. **Avoid Flaky Tests**: Make tests deterministic
